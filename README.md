# ThinkBridge UI Suggestion for Best New Electric Supply Application

Remove empty space at the bottom of the page.

Need space between radio button/ list the radio button instead of having it in the same line.

Remove grid/lines in the form.

Need space between each fields(right side)

All text field size should be unique to make the UI in a pleasant manner.

Add placeholder text for Drop down instead of empty value.

Instead of displaying all sections at single page ,Can we have it as next window in the same page.

Background color needs to be white for better view.

Too many colors in different section is not needed it is impacting the User Interface Aesthetics.

For upload fields, validation is getting displayed at the bottom instead of displaying beside the field.

View photo/view signature seems to be broken in the page. If the user didn't upload any image.

Favicon needs to be displayed in browser tab.

It would be better if we display the alert in marquee text.

Special characters should be removed in the page title.

Instead of displaying help in static text, it would be better if we have as help icon. by clicking on help icon,text should be displayed.

Too many fields in the single lie.(Example-Total load/calculate load)

For Address, it would be better if we gave 'use my current location' using MAP API.

Field Names needs to be bold.

All the fields needs to be either left aligned/center aligned.

Instead of phone number, we can give work number

For purpose of supply field, instead of drop down we can give picker field since it has too many options.

Progress bar needs to be updated with good animations /loading screen

For upload documents, we can mention the list of extensions and maximum size as instruction.
